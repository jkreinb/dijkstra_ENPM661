# ENPM661 Project 2 - Dijkstra

This program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient path in a 400x250 sized workspace
also generated, showing all nodes that were searched, and their indices. Visualizes search algorithm in workspace by using openCV.

## Dependencies:

* __time__ - tracks computation time

* __numpy__ - general matrix operations

* __heapq__ - binary tree generation

* __cv2__ - visualization

* __math__ - matrix math operations

## Instructions:

1. Run program.
2. Enter Goal location in (x,y) format
3. Enter Starting location in (x,y) format when prompted
4. Visualization will show obstacles as blue nodes, and current searched nodes will appear as white.
5. If a goal is found, a green line will be drawn to show the most efficient path to the goal.
6. When visualization is complete press "0" key to close window and complete program.

## Outputs:

* Visualization window

* No text outputs
